# Whiteboard

The Interactive Whiteboard Application is a web-based tool designed to facilitate collaborative and creative note-taking, brainstorming, and idea sharing. Users can draw freehand notes using various colors and brush sizes, add text areas that are draggable for easy positioning, insert images directly onto the canvas, and download their creations for offline use or sharing.
